Dark but not bright theme for long coding sessions. Heavily inspired by [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com) and similar themes. Removes some VSCode-specific code blinking on code selection or focus.

Includes minimal Icon Theme (thanks [Serendipity](https://github.com/Serendipity-Theme/vs-code) for inspiration)
